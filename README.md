# Recipe Book - An Interactive MERN Application

## Description

Our collaborative MERN-stack application was created using technology to build a user-focused platform. Some of the tools we used were back-end technologies like MongoDB, GraphQL API, Node.js, and Express.js and front-end technologies like React, and a user authenticator called JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Our objective was to used incorporate agile method of work flow by using GitHub, managing the project with Kanban boards and WireFrames, and implementing GitFlow efficiencies like clean branches for each feature helping troubleshooting for bug fixes and pull requests. 

The following application embodies a multitude of features. As you explore this application you will see a well polished UI on a site that was deployed onto Heroku with live data being served up by React components tested with GraphQL, MongoDB and seeded using Mongoose ODM database. This site is responsive and interactive with the intention of protecting sensitive information using API keys and web tokens for user sessions. You will also see a clean repository that meets quality coding standards like naming convention and file structure and of course this high-quality README to explain in detail what this project has materialized into.
